## The Design of extensions / Extensions

> #### ```/LndHub/extensions/admin```
There is a ```/LndHub/extensions/*``` folder where one can extend LndHub and run in same memory area,


> #### ```/LndHub-Extensions/*```
and there is ```/LndHub-Extensions``` that lives outside of the LndHub folder (for babel build reasons) 
invocated in its own memory area while sharing the Redis DB and use API calls to LndHub-Admin core.



The ```/LndHub-Extensions/*``` can use any Language and Framework while authenticating to LndHub-Admin core API.
